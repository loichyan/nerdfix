## [0.4.1] - 2024-07-14

This release mainly addresses the high memory usage issue reported in
[#18](https://github.com/loichyan/nerdfix/pull/18): fixed a potential memory leak in
[#21](https://github.com/loichyan/nerdfix/pull/21), and implemented stream processing in
[#22](https://github.com/loichyan/nerdfix/pull/22).

Also, some UI changes were introduced in [#21](https://github.com/loichyan/nerdfix/pull/21), as we
switched the diagnostic reporter from
[codespan_reporting](https://docs.rs/codespan-reporting/latest/codespan_reporting) to
[miette](https://docs.rs/miette/latest/miette).

### Added

- Support filter out binary files

  ([aa29181](https://github.com/loichyan/nerdfix/commit/aa29181aa41c094e60e519b7c61b95adf331f866)).
- Fix potential memory leaks ([#21](https://github.com/loichyan/nerdfix/pull/21)).

## [0.4.0] - 2023-10-20

This release introduces the predefined substitutions support suggested in
[#9](https://github.com/loichyan/nerdfix/issues/9) (thanks [@Finii](https://github.com/Finii)), and
also brings some UX breaking changes. Here are some guides for migrating from `v0.3`:

1. Use `dump` instead of `cache` to show all icons and substitutions in the runtime database.
2. The Previous release supports use `--replace FROM:TO` to perform a prefix substitution, now it
   uses the newly add `--sub TYPE:FROM/TO` argument to support both `exact` and `prefix`
   substitutions. This means that you should use `--sub prefix:FROM/TO` in place of the old one.

### Added

- Add `-v/-q` to control log level
  ([1294e24](https://github.com/loichyan/nerdfix/commit/1294e24972baaf5e0b88a3021745f2ae6a261e20)).

- [**breaking**] Deprecated `--replace FROM:TO`, use `--sub prefix:FROM/TO` instead
