`nerdfix` helps you to find/fix obsolete
[Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) icons in your project.

## üí≠ Why

Nerd Fonts is used in many projects for a beautiful UI. It provides more than
10,000 icons, but some codepoints conflict with other fonts (especially CJK
fonts). To ensure that the icons remain in the private use area, Nerd Fonts has
changed the codepoints of some icons in recent releases, for example, `nf-mdi-*`
icons (including over 2,000 icons) are deprecated since
[v2.3.3](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/tag/v2.3.3) and will
be removed in v3.

These icons are marked as obsolete in
[the official cheat sheet](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet) and it's
recommended to replace them with the new ones. However, you may find it boring
to check all the used icons one by one, so `nerdfix` was written to index the
cheat sheet and find obsolete icons in your project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You can download the pre-built binaries from
[the release page](https://github.com/loichyan/nerdfix/releases/latest) or
manually build this project manually from source.

In addition, the binaries come with a recently updated cheat sheet and you can
overwrite it with the latest one using `nerdfix -i /path/to/your/file` (follow
[this link](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2017-01-04-icon-cheat-sheet.md)
to get the latest file).

### Install from source

You can build and install from the source code with `cargo`:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/loichyan/nerdfix.git
```

Or with `nix`:

```sh
nix run github:loichyan/nerdfix
```

## üìã Note

Please make sure you're using Nerd Fonts after v2.3.3, otherwise the replaced
new icons may not be displayed correctly. If you are a plugin author, it's also
recommended to notify this in updates.

## üîç Usage

The `check` command checks input files and reports obsolete icons with some
suggestions (sorted by similarity) that you could replace them with.

```sh
nerdfix check test/test-data.txt
```

You get the output as follows:

```text
warning: Found obsolete icon U+F752
  ‚îå‚îÄ tests/test-data.txt:1:27
  ‚îÇ
1 ‚îÇ nf-mdi-folder_multiple = "Ôùí"
  ‚îÇ                           ^ Icon 'nf-mdi-folder_multiple' is marked as obsolete
  ‚îÇ
  = You could replace it with:
        1. Û∞âì U+F0253 nf-md-folder_multiple
        2. Û±èì U+F13D3 nf-md-folder_star_multiple
        ...
```

### Interactive patching

The `fix` command reports the same information as `check` and displays a prompt
asking the user to input a new icon to replace the obsolete one.

```text
warning: Found obsolete icon U+F719
  ‚îå‚îÄ tests/test-data.txt:4:29
  ‚îÇ
4 ‚îÇ nf-mdi-file_document_box = "Ôúô"
  ‚îÇ                             ^ Icon 'nf-mdi-file_document_box' is marked as obsolete
  ‚îÇ
  = You could replace it with:
        1. Û∞àô U+F0219 nf-md-file_document
        2. Û∞∑à U+F0DC8 nf-md-file_document_edit
        ...
> Input an icon: 1
# Your input: Û∞àô
```

The prompt accepts several types of input:

| Type              | Example               |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Suggestion number | `1`                   |
| Codepoint         | `U+F0219`             |
| Icon name         | `nf-md-file_document` |
| Icon character    | `Û∞àô`                   |

### Fuzzy autocompletion/search

The prompt also provides fuzzy matching suggestions when you type the icon name:

```text
> Input an icon: documentmultiple
  Û±îó nf-md-file_document_multiple
  Û±îò nf-md-file_document_multiple_outline
  Û∞°ü nf-md-comment_multiple
  ...
```

You can also use the `search` command to call the prompt directly for a fuzzy
search.

### Autofix

`nerdfix` provides some features to automatically patch obsolete icons:

- The last user input is picked if an icon appears twice.
- Use `fix --replace FROM,TO` to replace the prefix of an icon name with
  another, e.g. `nf-mdi-tab` is replaced with `nf-md-tab` when
  `--replace nf-mdi-,nf-md-` is specified.

### Structured output

You can use `check --format json` to get structured output for further use.
`nerdfix` prints diagnostics with the following fields line by line:

| Field       | Description                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `severity`  | Severity of a diagnostic                                |
| `path`      | Source file of a diagnostic                             |
| `type`      | Diagnostic type, currently only `obsolete` is supported |
| `span`      | Byte index span of an obsolete icon                     |
| `name`      | Icon name                                               |
| `codepoint` | Icon codepoint                                          |
